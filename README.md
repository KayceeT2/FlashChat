# FlashChat
## What We Will Create

Weâ€™re going to make a Flash Chat App, where you can register or login on a device/simulator and then you will be able to type a message and "chat" with someone, aka you on a different device/simulator.

## What You'll Learn

You will learn about Segues, For Loops, Installing Cocoapods & Other Alternatives, Adding & Using Firebase, and much more.
